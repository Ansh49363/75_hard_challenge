            <h2>The 75 Hard Challenge</h2>
<p>The 75 Hard Challenge was created in 2019 by entrepreneur <b>Andy Frisella</b>, a podcaster and CEO of the supplement company 1st Phorm. 75 Hard is not a fitness challenge, but a “transformative mental toughness program”.

<br><br>
Frisella created 75 Hard after interviewing James Lawrence, who’s known as the Iron Cowboy for completing 50 Ironman races in 50 consecutive days across all 50 states. After Lawrence told Frisella that you must intentionally put yourself in places that are uncomfortable in order to develop mental fortitude, Frisella was inspired to create 75 Hard.</p>

Consistency is key when it comes to seeing results from any type of health and fitness plan.”

Personal trainer and kettlebell coach Sophie Banyard also completed 75 Hard, and she found the program tough but doable. “It taught me a lot about what you can actually fit into a day if you put your mind to it,” she says. Banyard credits the challenge as the catalyst for her giving up alcohol entirely, which she regards as one of the best decisions she’s ever made.</p>
